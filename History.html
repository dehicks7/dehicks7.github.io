<p> In the years when the mob ran this town, times were tough. No one around here was aloud to eat unless someone from the mob
told you it was ok. Joe's Grill helped bridge that gap, they served Mob and not Mob affiliate equally the same, and we made it a house
priority not to ask any questions. We know that questions tend to come from people wiser than us, wise guys some might call them,
we also know that we should stick with what we are good at, and what we are good at is making steaks. Come on down and join us, we are no longer
affiliated with the mob, at least not that we know of, and we still wont ask any questions.</p>
