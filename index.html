older than some of the high-rise buildings that are so iconic to our city-scape and withstanding the test of time
when it comes preparing the best steaks in the state. We have a long held tratition of ageing our cuts in a dry room
for at least 10 days and making everything from scratch home made recepies that are older than we are </p>
