<p>
Joes Grill was founded as a place for the mob to lie low back in the 1920's, in between thier bouts of money laundering,
human trafficking, embezzlement, and loan sharking around town, they needed a place to relax. We noticed that there was
a market for prime Seafood and Steaks to be served to the Mob Bosses and thier lackies and as such Joes Grill was born.
We were sure to add on an extra freezer storage area, and an extra loading dock in case they were needed; And while we
attribute our success to the success of the mob we want to be very clear that we in no way helped or aided them in any 
of thier tasks. </p>
<p>

Fast forward a few decades and here we are, still serving people of all types, often times it might appear as if you
were still dining around Mob Bosses, but that time is long gone; though the extra freezer and loading dock still
are used frequently, we cannot stress enough it is not the Mob. You might notice when you enter that there are a few privat
dining rooms and even a couple trap doors, these of course are relics, rarely used today. We would like to take the time
here to absolutely unequivically state that we are no longer affiliated with the Mob.
